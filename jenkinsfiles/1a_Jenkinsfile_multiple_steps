/*
This code is a Jenkins Pipeline script written in Groovy. It defines a CI/CD pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy.
*/
/*
pipeline { ... }: The top-level block that defines the Jenkins Pipeline.
agent any: Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent.
stages { ... }: Contains the sequence of stages that make up the pipeline.
stage('Build'):
steps { ... }: Lists the actions to perform in this stage.
echo 'This is Build Stage.': Prints a message to the console.
echo 'This is Jenkins Job': Prints another message.
sh ''' ... ''': Runs a shell script that prints a message and changes the directory to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace.
stage('Test'):

steps { ... }:
echo 'This is Test Stage.': Prints a message indicating this is the test stage.
stage('Deploy'):

steps { ... }:
echo 'This is Deploy Stage.': Prints a message indicating this is the deploy stage.
Summary:
This pipeline will run on any Jenkins agent and execute three sequential stages—Build, Test, and Deploy—each printing messages to the console. The Build stage also runs a shell script demonstrating how to execute shell commands in Jenkins.

If you want further details or have questions about specific parts, let me know!
